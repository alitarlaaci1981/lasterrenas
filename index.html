                <p class="text">
                    We highly encourage all Wing Chun Kung Fu practitioners to arrive in the Dominican Republic a day before the retreat begins. The journey from Santo Domingo Airport to Las Terrenas takes about three hours, including a ride to the bus stop and a bus journey to Las Terrenas. 
                    <span class="more-text"><br>Arriving early gives you a wonderful opportunity to settle into your hotel room, unpack, set up internet on your phone, rent a four-wheeler (ATV), shop, and explore the beautiful surroundings. This extra day will ensure you’re well-rested and ready to fully immerse yourself in the transformative experience of our retreat!

                    There are several mobile operators in the Dominican Republic that offer prepaid SIM cards, including Claro, Orange, and Viva.(We can definitely recommend CLARO since it has a wide coverage and setup is really Quick) 
                    <span class="more-text">These SIM cards can be purchased at various locations such as airports, convenience stores, and official stores of the mobile operators. In tourist areas it is almost perfect, but in the hinterland it can slow down.<br>
                        It is advisable to purchase SIM cards of local providers in official phone shops. A shop assistant will help to activate and connect the selected package. Buying a SIM card in the Dominican Republic is possible by providing a passport.

                    Only prepaid data plans are sold to tourists, there are no contract data packages.<br>
                    <span class="more-text"><strong>Important:</strong> do not buy SIM cards from street sellers or in souvenir stores.<br> Although you do not need a passport for such purchases, you risk buying illegal cards that can be blocked at any time. Of course they are overpriced.</span>
