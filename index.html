                        Embark on an adventurous journey on Tuesday, February 11th, with your family on a tour to the breathtaking Limón Waterfall. Participants have the option to either ride a horse or take the trail through the lush forest, experiencing the natural beauty of the Dominican Republic. Fellow Kung Fu brothers, we have the option to be picked up by the tour company or we can ride to the town of El Limón before starting our tour to Salto del Limón Waterfall.<br><br>
                    We'll saddle up and begin our trek through the verdant landscape until we reach the majestic 165-foot high Limón Waterfall, one of the highest and most stunning waterfalls in the country. Upon arriving at the ranch where we leave the horses, we'll be greeted with an incredible view of the cascading fall below.<br><br>
                    On the way back to our starting point, we will conclude our adventure with a delicious lunch. The tour is expected to wrap up around 2:30 - 3:00 pm, giving us flexibility based on the day's flow. Then, we'll head back to Las Terrenas where the rest of the day will be ours to enjoy. Imagine relaxing on the stunning beaches, soaking in the tropical weather with your family, and having the perfect backdrop for continuing our invigorating Kung Fu training. It's the ultimate blend of leisure and practice in paradise! <br><br>

                        <strong>Los Haitises and Paraiso Caño Hondo visit</strong><br><br>
                        Our journey with family and friends begins with a scenic departure from Las Terrenas to Sanchez, where we will board a boat for an exciting visit to Los Haitises. The drive to Sanchez will take approximately 25 minutes.<br><br>
                        The word: Haitises comes from Arawak which was the Taino language and means high land or land of mountains, although the set of hills or "mogotes" have heights that range between 30 and 40 meters. An important aspect is the karstic geomorphological formation that determines, among other things, a system of caves such as the caves "de La Arena", "de San Gabriel" and "del Ferrocarril" - also known as "de la Línea" or "del Templo" - that contain pictographs, bas-reliefs and petroglyphs. Afterward, we will head to Cano Hondo, renowned for its beautiful natural pools.<br><br>
                        Paraiso Caño Hondo is located in the Los Haitises National Park, in the northeastern region of the Dominican Republic. The eco-lodge is situated in the town of Sabana de la Mar, which is approximately 5.6 miles away. The lodge is surrounded by lush greenery and is known for its natural pools and waterfalls. Visitors can enjoy the stunning views of the surrounding mountains and forests, while also taking a dip in the refreshing waters.<br><br>
                        We'll stay at Cano Hondo for about three hours, enjoying a delicious lunch amidst the tranquil surroundings. Following this relaxing break, we have planned an invigorating two-hour session of kung fu practice with our skilled kung fu brothers.<br><br>
                        Join us for an unforgettable day filled with exploration, relaxation, and cultural enrichment!<br><br>

              <p>
                We recommend travelers consider renting an ATV (4-Wheeler) to explore the area. ATVs provide an easy and enjoyable way to navigate around, go shopping, and sightsee. However, we understand that not everyone may want to rent an ATV. For those who prefer other modes of transportation, renting a motorcycle or scooter is also a great option. These alternatives offer the same convenience and freedom to discover the local attractions at your own pace. No matter your choice, you'll find the perfect vehicle to enhance your travel experience.<br><br>
                For those interested in renting an ATV, we have an arrangement with <strong>Obispo from ATM Travel Tours.</strong> Mention our retreat name,<strong>Las Terrenas Wing Chun Vacation Retreat</strong> to receive a special price of $40 per day. This company is one we have worked with before and is very reliable. While everyone is free to choose their preferred mode of transportation, we highly recommend this option for its convenience and reliability.</p>

                    We highly encourage all Wing Chun Kung Fu practitioners to arrive in the Dominican Republic a day before the retreat begins. The journey from Santo Domingo Airport to Las Terrenas takes about three hours, including a ride to the bus stop and a bus journey to Las Terrenas. 
                    <span class="more-text"><br>Arriving early gives you a wonderful opportunity to settle into your hotel room, unpack, set up internet on your phone, rent a four-wheeler (ATV), shop, and explore the beautiful surroundings. This extra day will ensure you’re well-rested and ready to fully immerse yourself in the transformative experience of our retreat!

                    There are several mobile operators in the Dominican Republic that offer prepaid SIM cards, including Claro, Orange, and Viva.(We can definitely recommend CLARO since it has a wide coverage and setup is really Quick) 
                    <span class="more-text">These SIM cards can be purchased at various locations such as airports, convenience stores, and official stores of the mobile operators. In tourist areas it is almost perfect, but in the hinterland it can slow down.<br>
                        It is advisable to purchase SIM cards of local providers in official phone shops. A shop assistant will help to activate and connect the selected package. Buying a SIM card in the Dominican Republic is possible by providing a passport.

                    <span class="more-text"><strong>Important:</strong> do not buy SIM cards from street sellers or in souvenir stores.<br> Although you do not need a passport for such purchases, you risk buying illegal cards that can be blocked at any time. Of course they are overpriced.</span>
